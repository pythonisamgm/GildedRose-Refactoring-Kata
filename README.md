# Gilded Rose Refactoring and Testing Project

## Project Overview

This project involved refactoring the Gilded Rose Kata code and creating comprehensive tests for its functionality. The aim was to improve code quality, readability, and maintainability while ensuring the existing functionality remains unchanged.

## Stages of the Project

### Stage 1: Initial Code Assessment

- **Objective:** Understand the existing implementation of the `GildedRose` class and its methods.
- **Tasks:**
  - Reviewed the initial code to identify areas of improvement.
  - Analyzed how different types of items are handled in the `updateQuality` method.

### Stage 2: Initial Test Creation

- **Objective:** Create initial tests to ensure that the existing functionality is preserved during the refactoring process.
- **Tasks:**
  - Developed unit tests for various scenarios, including regular items, "Aged Brie", "Sulfuras", "Backstage passes", and "Conjured" items.
  - Verified the correctness of the initial implementation using these tests.

### Stage 3: Code Refactoring

- **Objective:** Refactor the code to improve clarity, reduce complexity, and enhance maintainability.
- **Tasks:**
  - Extracted logic for different types of items into separate methods or classes.
  - Simplified the `updateQuality` method by delegating responsibilities to item-specific methods or classes.
  - Ensured that the refactored code passed all the initial tests.

### Stage 4: Enhancing Functionality

- **Objective:** Extend the functionality to handle additional requirements and edge cases.
- **Tasks:**
  - Updated the logic for "Conjured" items to degrade quality twice as fast as regular items.
  - Introduced checks to ensure that the quality of an item is never negative and never exceeds 50, except for "Sulfuras".

### Stage 5: Additional Refactoring

- **Objective:** Further improve the design by implementing object-oriented principles.
- **Tasks:**
  - Created a base class for items and derived specific item classes for "Aged Brie", "Sulfuras", "Backstage passes", and "Conjured" items.
  - Implemented an interface for updating quality and applied it to all item classes.
  - Replaced conditional logic in the `GildedRose` class with polymorphism.

### Stage 6: Comprehensive Testing

- **Objective:** Ensure complete coverage of all possible scenarios and edge cases.
- **Tasks:**
  - Created additional unit tests for newly introduced functionalities and edge cases.
  - Used the tests to validate the behavior of the refactored code.
  - Ensured all tests passed successfully, confirming that the refactoring did not introduce any regressions.

### Stage 7: Final Review and Documentation

- **Objective:** Finalize the project with thorough documentation and review.
- **Tasks:**
  - Conducted a code review to ensure the refactored code adheres to best practices.
  - Documented the design decisions, explaining the rationale behind the refactoring.
  - Prepared a comprehensive README file to guide future developers through the codebase and tests.

## Conclusion

The project successfully refactored the Gilded Rose Kata code, enhancing its structure, readability, and maintainability. The comprehensive tests ensure that the existing functionality is preserved and that the codebase is robust against future changes. This refactoring lays a solid foundation for further development and extension of the Gilded Rose system.
